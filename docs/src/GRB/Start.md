## Accelerated Charge Radiate
Uniform velocities can't produce any qualitatively different phenomena compared to those due 
to a charge at rest, because from another Lorentz frame the charge is at rest. 

from Maxwell equation

$\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}$ 

or from d'Alembert equation

$\nabla^2 \vec{\mathbf{A}} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \vec{\mathbf{A}}}{\partial t^2}  = - \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}$ 

because $\vec{\mathbf{j}} = q \vec{\mathbf{v}}$, the $\vec{\mathbf{A}}$ scales as the $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ of the charge,
so the $\dot{\vec{\mathbf{A}}}$ is proportional to $\vec{\mathbf{a}}$. This correspond to a 
nonzero $\partial \vec{\mathbf{j}}/\partial t$ and hence a nonzero $\partial \vec{\mathbf{B}}/\partial t$. 

It will induce an electric field (one part of $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$) which is linear in the acceleration 
$\vec{\mathbf{a}}$. Because $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$ is also linear in the charge, it has to be constructed from $q$, $a$, $c$, and $r$ and hence must have the 
general form (_in the instantaneous rest frame of the charge_):

$E = C(\theta)\frac{q a}{c^n r^m}$ 

where $C$ is dimensionless and we can know from dimensional analysis that $n = 2$ and $m = 1$.
$C$ only depend on the angle $\theta$ between $\vec{\mathbf{r}}$ and $\vec{\mathbf{a}}$.
At large distances from the accelerated charge particle, $\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} = 4 \pi \rho$
still hold. The flux of the electric field through a spherical surface at a large
distance should be equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface. Since the Coulomb field
already satisfies this condition, $\vec{\mathbf{E}}_{rad}$ must normal to the radius vector.
